    <h1>The Story of <span class="highlight">Ayyuush</span></h1>
    <h3>“Broken bones. Unbroken spirit.”</h3>
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>
      Real name <span class="highlight">Arif</span>, but the world calls him <span class="highlight">Ayyuush</span>.  
      From the beautiful land of Assam, India, this young soul carries dreams far greater than himself.
      A student of Class 11 Science, with a heart full of courage — he’s walking a path that connects both logic and justice.
    </p>

    <p>
      He dreams of wearing the uniform of a <span class="highlight">Police Officer</span>, standing for truth.  
      And at the same time, mastering the world of cyber knowledge — becoming a <span class="highlight">White Cap Hacker</span>.  
      His mission: to protect people, both on ground and online.
    </p>

    <p>
      But the story wasn’t easy.  
      Back in Class 2, a small playful push from a friend broke both his hands.  
      No anger, no hate — only pain, and a stronger will.  
      Again in Class 4, while washing mangoes outside, he slipped — and the same hands broke again.  
      Yet he smiled through the pain.
    </p>

    <p>
      His school, <span class="highlight">Sankar Ajan Jatiya Vidyalaya</span>, gave him more than just education — it gave him a family of twelve.  
      <br><br>
      <strong>The 12 Diamonds:</strong> Muzahid, Mumin, Arsaful, Sidhartha, Debojyuti, Prodyut, Tanushree, Sibani, Punima, Susmita, Arfin — and Ayyuush himself.  
      Together, they created memories that time can’t erase.
    </p>

    <p>
      Life tested him — weak eyesight, broken hands, and challenges many would give up on.  
      But not him.  
      His heart beats with a fire:  
      <span class="highlight">“Main gir gaya tha… par kabhi ruk nahi gaya.”</span>
    </p>

    <p>
      One dream keeps him alive — to meet <span class="highlight">MS Dhoni</span> once before he leaves this world.  
      Because like Dhoni, he too believes that calmness is power.
    </p>

    <p>
      From a small town boy to a rising dreamer — this is not just a story.  
      It’s a message to everyone who ever felt broken:
      <br><br>
      <strong>“Zindagi haath tod sakti hai… par sapne nahi.”</strong>
